Example:

	it6251@5c {
		compatible = "ite,it6251";
		reg = <0x5c>, <0x5e>;
		reg-names = "bridge", "lvds";
		power-supply = <&reg_display>;

		ports {
			port@0 {
				bridge_out_edp0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&panel_in_edp0>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				bridge_in_lvds0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&lvds0_out>;
				};
